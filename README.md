Chord Diagrams in Elm 

**VERY WIP**

At the moment this package can draw the geometry, position and rotate labels, and assigm colours to the geometry.

I've also added a predefined horizontal stretching based on a tutorial by [Nadieh Bremer/Visual Cinnamon](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/2015/08/stretched-chord.html).
It seems like this could be generalized to move along the normal of some section of the circle.

I'm now actively looking for usage examples to make a meaningful api that allows for customization but is better than "here is some svg, good luck!".
